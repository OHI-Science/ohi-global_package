# ohi-global_package
Start of package with ohi-global specific functions and data.

We have various data and functions specific to the OHI global analysis.  Some of these are located in ohi-global (such as, mapping functions) and others are in ohicore (such as, names to region, etc.).  For now, I am going to move these into here, with the intention that we will ultimately convert this to a package, similar to ohicore.
